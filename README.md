# "0-10 people randomly walking in a constrained area, for a total of 88,000 radar signals (440 measurements)
This project focuses on people counting using radar sensor data.
Unlike camera-based systems, radar offers advantages such as privacy preservation, robustness to lighting conditions, and reliable performance in indoor environments.

The objective of this work is to process radar signal data and develop machine learning–based methods to estimate the number of people present in different scenarios.
